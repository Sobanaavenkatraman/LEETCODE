Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

*************** SOLUTION CODE ***************

class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        f,s = 0,0
        for i in num1:
            f = f*10 + (ord(i)-48)
        for i in num2:
            s = s*10 + (ord(i)-48)
        return str(f*s)
