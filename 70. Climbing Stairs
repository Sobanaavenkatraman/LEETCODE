You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        series = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            next = series[i - 1] + series[i - 2]
            series.append(next)
        return series[n-1] + series[n]
