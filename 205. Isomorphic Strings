Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        first, sec = [], []
        for el in s:
            first.append(s.index(el))
        for el in t:
            sec.append(t.index(el))
        if first == sec:
            return True
        return False
